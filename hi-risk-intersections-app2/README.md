##NZ's Highest Risk Intersections app

I created this visualisation using the leaflet package in R. I downloaded the input dataset from the NZTA website.

I needed to convert the Northings and Eastings in the original dataset into latitude and longitude. 
To do this, I used the coordinate conversion tool on the LINZ website.

A live version of this app can be found [here](https://conrad.shinyapps.io/high-risk-intersections-nz/).

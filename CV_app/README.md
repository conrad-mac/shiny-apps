##CV app using Shiny, Boostrap, and Datacamp

This is a single page Curriculum Vitae (or Resume) which I intend to host on shinyapps.io - hence why it is 
embedded in a Shiny app (and doesn't do anything on the R server side). 

The bootstrap theme is courtesy of Xiaoying Riley at 3rd Wave Media and is free under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. 

The page has two emebedded Datacamp 'playgrounds' at the bottom (one for R and one for Python). The idea is that this makes the page
a little more interactive.
